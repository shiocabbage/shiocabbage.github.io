<div align="center"><h1>INTRODUCTION</h1></div>

"shiocab project" is the project run by "shiocabbage(塩キャベツ)", GitHub user, to make creating easier just a little.

You can watch scripts of "shiocab project" page.
Also, you can download "shiocab.js" and "shiocab.css" except "jquery-3.1.0.min.js" and use for your website.
Sure, if you don't download, you can use them by coding following passages,
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://shiocabbage.github.io/shiocab.css">
<script src="https://shiocabbage.github.io/shiocab-1.0.js"></script>
```
in ``` <head>~</head>```.

##BUT they are working by USING "jQuery".
So, you must download javascript file to use them from <a>https://jquery.com/</a> and link to "jQuery source" before you use them.

I'm so glad you reading this introducion.

Thank you.
